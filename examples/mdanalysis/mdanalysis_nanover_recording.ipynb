We will use a pre-prepared recording of an OpenMM simulation of the methane + nanotube system examined in the [OpenMM nanotube tutorial](../openmm/openmm_nanotube.ipynb). If you're looking for a challenge, check out our [OpenMM polyalanine simulation notebook](../openmm/openmm_polyalanine.ipynb) first to learn how to record your own iMD-VR simulation to analyse!\n",
